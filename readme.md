# Dealux

The Online Shopping Comparison Platform is a web application designed to enhance the online shopping experience by allowing users to search and compare products across multiple e-commerce sites. By integrating APIs from leading retailers such as Shopee, Lazada, Zalora, Alibaba, Shein, and eBay, the platform provides users with the ability to find the best deals and quality products available. Users can rank products based on criteria like highest rating or lowest price and make purchases directly within the app.
